# 🚀 Welcome to the Anime UI — Flutter UI Challenge (task for testing) repository!


# 🔧 Project Overview
This is a Flutter UI-only project designed as part of a challenge to build an anime-themed application interface.
The project contains only the user interface (no business logic, no APIs, no state management).
It’s structured using a Clean Architecture-inspired folder setup — focused on separating files and keeping the project maintainable, even though it currently includes UI only.




# ✨ Features

* **Built with Dart & Flutter Framework for seamless performance and stunning UI.**<br>
* **structured using a Clean Architecture.**<br>
* **Anime-themed user interface (home, details, tabs, etc.).**<br>
* **Basic animations & transitions for a smoother look.**<br>
* **Organized using Clean Architecture file structure.**<br>
* **Mock/fake data only for preview purposes.**<br>
* **Easy to extend into a full-featured app later.**<br>
